            <h1>Marine Turtles</h1>
            <p>Marine turtles have inhabited the earth for over 100 million years and have evolved from tortoise-like animals. They have a head, a short neck, long foreflippers, short and rounded hind flippers, and a tail. They are reptiles and cold-blooded, so their body temperature is determined by the environment. They are fast and agile swimmers with long and muscular foreflippers, rudder-like hind flippers, and flattened shells. Marine turtles are highly migratory, moving between nesting and feeding grounds thousands of kilometers apart. </p>

            <p>
                Between feeding and nesting grounds, sea turtles travel long distances. The average distance travelled by a leatherback is 3,700 miles. Sea turtles lay their eggs on beaches after mating at sea. In the case of the leatherback, females excavate a hole in the sand, lay their clutch of eggs (up to 100), cover it back up, and then re-enter the water.
                <br>
                The eggs hatch after about 60 days, and the tiny hatchlings go from the nest to the water at night. This is frequently a dangerous journey because seabirds, crabs, and other predators hunt on the baby turtles. The growth of the seashore poses another danger. The hatchings are guided to the ocean by natural light towards the horizon. Hotel, home, and other building lights can

                Six of the seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened or endangered across the globe as a result of human behavior and way of life. There are many ways that people harm these animals, from people catching them with fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs.

            <h1>Turtle Hatcheries In Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>
                In Sri Lanka, sea turtle conservation and protection are greatly aided by turtle hatcheries. These hatcheries offer a secure environment for turtle eggs to hatch, releasing young turtles into the sea safe from both predatory animals and human activity. <br> Sea turtles play a significant role in maintaining the harmony of the marine food chain and the marine ecology. Additionally, through ecotourism, turtle hatcheries help the local economy by creating jobs and money for communities.
